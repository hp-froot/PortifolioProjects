# **Data Analyst Portfolio**
Welcome to my portfolio! This repository serves as a showcase of my skills as a data analyst.

## **Project 1: Exploring COVID Data**
In my first project, I delved into COVID-19 data using SQL. This involved analyzing two key tables: one containing information on deaths and the other on vaccinations. By applying my SQL skills, I gained insights into various aspects of the pandemic, such as trends in mortality rates, vaccination coverage, and geographical patterns.

## **Project 2: Cleaning Nashville Housing Data**
For my second project, I worked with housing data from Nashville using SQL. This dataset included information about property buyers, sale prices, dates, addresses, and more. I applied data cleaning techniques to preprocess the data, ensuring it was ready for in-depth analysis. By cleaning and organizing the data effectively, I enhanced its usability for future analytical tasks.

## **Project 3: Analyzing Bike Sales Data Using Excel**
In my third project, I analyzed bike sales data using Excel. This project involved multiple steps:

1. Data Cleaning: I began by cleaning the raw data, ensuring consistency and accuracy.
2. Pivot Table Creation: I created pivot tables to summarize and aggregate the data based on different dimensions such as commute, gender, and income.
3. Visual Dashboard: Using the insights from the pivot tables, I designed a visual dashboard to present key findings and trends in an easily understandable format.

## **Project 4: Airbnb Analysis in Barcelona Using Tableau**
In my fourth project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of Airbnb data in Barcelona using Tableau. This project focused on identifying the most profitable factors influencing Airbnb listings, such as neighborhood, room type and pricing dynamics.

Through interactive visualizations created in Tableau, I explored various dimensions of the data to uncover insights and trends. By analyzing factors I aimed to provide valuable insights for both hosts and potential guests in the Barcelona area.

## **Project 5: Creating a Dashboard for Data Professionals' Survey Using Power BI**
For my fifth project, I used data from Alex The Analyst's survey of people working in the data field. This survey collected information on their salaries, locations, career transitions, job roles, and more. I started by cleaning the data to ensure its accuracy and consistency. Then, I created an interactive dashboard using Power BI to visualize the survey results, providing insights into the demographics, career paths, and earnings of data professionals.
