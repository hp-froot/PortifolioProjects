# **Data Analyst Portfolio**
Welcome to my portfolio! This repository serves as a showcase of my skills as a data analyst.

## **Project 1: Exploring COVID Data**
In my first project, I delved into COVID-19 data using SQL. This involved analyzing two key tables: one containing information on deaths and the other on vaccinations. By applying my SQL skills, I gained insights into various aspects of the pandemic, such as trends in mortality rates, vaccination coverage, and geographical patterns.

## **Project 2: Cleaning Nashville Housing Data**
For my second project, I worked with housing data from Nashville using SQL. This dataset included information about property buyers, sale prices, dates, addresses, and more. I applied data cleaning techniques to preprocess the data, ensuring it was ready for in-depth analysis. By cleaning and organizing the data effectively, I enhanced its usability for future analytical tasks.

## **Project 3: Analyzing Bike Sales Data Using Excel**
In my third project, I analyzed bike sales data using Excel. This project involved multiple steps:

1. Data Cleaning: I began by cleaning the raw data, ensuring consistency and accuracy.
2. Pivot Table Creation: I created pivot tables to summarize and aggregate the data based on different dimensions such as commute, gender, and income.
3. Visual Dashboard: Using the insights from the pivot tables, I designed a visual dashboard to present key findings and trends in an easily understandable format.

Stay tuned for more exciting projects to come!
