# **Data Analyst Portfolio**
Welcome to my portfolio! This repository serves as a showcase of my skills as a data analyst.

## **Project 1: Exploring COVID Data**
In my first project, I delved into COVID-19 data using SQL. This involved analyzing two key tables: one containing information on deaths and the other on vaccinations. By applying my SQL skills, I gained insights into various aspects of the pandemic, such as trends in mortality rates, vaccination coverage, and geographical patterns.

Stay tuned for more exciting projects to come!
